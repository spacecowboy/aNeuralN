aNeuralN is a package for Artificial Neural Networks.

I made it in order to understand neural networks better. It so far supports gradient descent and genetic training.
A few pieces have been written as C-extensions in order to maximize the speed.

This package is now obsolete and has been replaced by https://github.com/spacecowboy/pysurvival-ann
