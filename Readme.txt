aNeuralN is a package for Artificial Neural Networks.

I made it in order to understand neural networks better. It so far supports gradient descent and genetic training.
A few pieces have been written as C-extensions in order to maximize the speed.

I will add more features as I need them since I use this code daily in my work as a PhD student in Computational Biology.
